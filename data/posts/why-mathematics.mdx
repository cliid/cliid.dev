Competition math drew me into the realm of mathematics, but what made me really love math as a discipline was the idea of connecting the dots — making seemingly distant connections between different areas of mathematics.

The concept of isomorphisms, from group homomorphisms (of group operations) to homeomorphisms (of topological properties), led me to wonder what could be considered the same, basically the same, or basically basically the same. I wanted to explore these connections and discover new patterns and insights.

One example of such a connection was Galois theory and the Abel-Ruffini theorem.

A year ago, I watched a video about this topic by Mathemaniac, and I was fascinated by the idea of a tower of radical extensions to represent the splitting field.
It struck me with a glimpse of something I had seen before: Gaussian integers. The first time I had encountered these “extensions,” it felt quite unnecessary to do so.

But later I realized that with the extensions, and the unique properties derived from them, it often made the previously unsolvable problems solvable. This showed me how thinking deeply about simple things, such as roots of polynomials or complex numbers, could reveal hidden symmetries and complexities.

Another area that intrigued me was complex analysis.

I read a Wikipedia article about analytic continuation, a process of extending the domain of a function using its power series representation;
the concept of analytic continuation felt both natural and odd to me.
Extending the domain of a function made some functions, like log(z), behave strangely, yet it was often desirable to do so. I wondered why this was the case and what implications it had for other functions and domains.

These examples made me think about how we extend mathematical ideas to the imaginary world, and then use elements from that world to solve problems that originated from our land.
As we proceed, we conquer the imaginary land and finally set it as a basecamp for further exploration.

This line of thinking led me to a Platonic point of view of our universe, that although we are inventors of notations, we are essentially discoverers of mathematics, which made me feel like mathematics is truly the other world that we are to discover.

Then, I thought, to which extreme can we put our intuition?

Indeed, the focus on intuition was what made me love number theory and combinatorics more than anything else.
They all arise from our basic intuition of counting numbers, but with continuous (or should I say, discrete) extensions,
we get to solve previously insurmountable problems.

This is why I also enjoy subjects such as graph theory, computational complexity theory, and algorithms, all of which require a high dose of intuition.

I love finding elegant and clever solutions that reveal the beauty and simplicity of mathematics.
