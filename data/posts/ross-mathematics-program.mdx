From June 11 to July 21, I attended the Ross Mathematics Program at Otterbein University, an intensive and selective 6-week summer program that aims to teach students topics in Number Theory.
During camp, I finished all of the regular problem sets, starting from the Axiom Set, reaching up to Set \#27, which was the final set.
I started from the Ring Axioms, Order Axioms, and WOP, but then as I slowly progressed,
I was able to reach deep concepts such as Dirichlet rings, Frobenius endomorphisms, formal power series, formal derivatives, and integer-valued polynomials.

I attended most of the advanced lectures given by counselors and students, whose topics ranged from spectral graph theory to Cantor sets, hypergeometric functions, measure theory, real analysis, point-set topology, game theory, auction theory, matching theory, homological algebra, modal logic, Suslin trees, ordinal collapsing functions, and the "back and forth argument."
I live-$\TeX$'ed notes for most of the advanced lectures, which I shared with other campers; [my notes](/static/files/cantor.pdf) for Prof. Vitaly Bergelson's lectures on "the multifarious Cantor set" were used by Prof. Bergelson and Prof. Daniel Shapiro as a basis for the compilation of the final notes.
(He likes to see students taking notes.)

I also regularly attended the ["What is?" seminars](https://math.osu.edu/activities/colloquium/what-is) at Ohio State University,
which was held on Tuesdays and Thursdays (which was possible thanks to Pico Gilman, who called Uber to drive us back and forth from Otterbein to OSU and vice versa, during which I could amend my sleep deprivation by taking short naps).
I was exposed to various mathematical folklore typically not covered in undergraduate (and even graduate) courses, such as Cantor spaces, the Furstenberg correspondence principle, Young tableaux, the invariant subspace problem, bicycle monodromy, and quasicrystals.

![Family 3](/static/images/fam-3.jpg)

At the end of week 3, our 'family' --- Jacob, Haoyu, Ava, Isabelle, and I --- [proved the Unique Factorization Theorem](/static/files/fam-3-celebration.pdf), starting from the Ring Axioms and the Well-Ordering Principle (WOP).
Doing this gave me a refreshing insight into how important the axioms are, and how crucial deep mathematical thinking is.
Although many people take unique factorization as granted, speaking of which I have to admit that I was one of those, it was truly amazing how many theorems were involved to prove unique factorization, and how nontrivial it actually is.
This experience opened a new side of my brain, that is, critical thinking --- keeping track of which results lead to which other results, which axioms are truly necessary, and detecting the chain of implications hidden beneath the often deceiving explanations done in natural language --- beyond just computational thinking.

I want to say thanks to Ben Gobler, who was my counselor this year,
for giving me lots of perplexing mathematical puzzles and teaching me interesting topics in discrete mathematics,
such as braid theory and visual group theory, starting from examples of groups,
reaching up to semidirect products, $p$-groups, classification of finite simple groups, and Sylow theorems.
I wish all the best in your Ph.D. journey at Clemson, and I hope to see you again.

In week 6, I gave an hour-long talk, titled [_Asymptotic Arguments using Density and Complexity_](/static/files/asymptotic-arguments.pdf), to my 'family,' comprising four first-year students, a junior counselor, and a counselor.
The talk covered topics on asymptotic analysis, including natural density, union bound, and Szemerédi's theorem.
For union bounds, I used Ukraine TST 2007/12 as a primer, to show how powerful such asymptotic bounds can be in terms of problem solving.

During Ross, I read the first few chapters of _Princeton Lectures in Analysis III: Measure Theory, Integration, and Hilbert Spaces_ by Stein,
mainly to prepare for the advanced lectures on Cantor sets given by Prof. Vitaly Bergelson at OSU.
In the meantime, I self-studied complex analysis through YouTube lectures by Petra Bonfert-Taylor,
_Complex Analysis_ by Serge Lang, and _Visual Complex Functions_ by Elias Wegert,
by which I learned Cauchy-Riemann equations, Laurent series, the Riemann mapping theorem, winding numbers, residue theorems, contour integrals, conformal mappings (Möbius transformations), phase portraits, and much more.

After camp, I started reading _Undergraduate Algebraic Geometry_ by Miles Reid, which I received as a prize at the ceremony at Ross/Ohio 2023,
and _The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves_ by Silverman, which I personally received as a gift from Xinkai Wu, who was my honorary counselor at Ross.
He introduced abstract algebra to me: he taught me from basic ring theory and field theory to Galois theory and class field theory,
assisting the regular class field theory lectures given by Bartu Bingol, who is also a counselor and a Ph.D. candidate in Mathematics at UMass Amherst.

> The game ends when the game stops. --- Xinkai

Xinkai also led "the dead game theorist's society," which consisted of 5 junior counselors and myself (the picture above is a group photo of the society's members).
At the late night meetings, we learned auction theory, matching theory, and game theory from Xinkai, specifically
Kakutani's fixed point theorem, Brouwer's fixed point theorem, two-sided matching, stable matchings, the kidney exchange problem, the marriage problem, and much more.

He adopted me as an honorary member of his 'family,' and provided me with a new community.
He also took me, Emma, and a couple other people out for family outings,
to CoCo (a Chinese hot pot place), a sushi restaurant, Whit's Frozen Custard, and Graeter's Ice Cream (at 10pm and other times), all of which I can never forget.
He also influenced my vernacular with hilarious phrases like "我操," "actually trivial," and "beyond stupid,"
all of which I picked up during Ross and were indeed proven to be very useful.

Thank you Xinkai, for all the things you have given to me ... _you were the reason why Ross was Ross to me._
Although I would not be able to see you for a while, as you are headed to Columbia University to pursue a Ph.D. in Economics and Game Theory, I will remember you forever.
I sincerely wish the best in your Ph.D. journey at Columbia, and I hope to see you again, 有缘千里来相会。

> Emma! Math! --- Pico, for the 100th time

Also, I want to thank Pico Gilman for letting me play endless games of team Golf, Doudizhu (斗地主), and Chinese Avalon until 5am,
actually messing up with my sleep schedule, also taking me and Emma to Whit's and Graeter's for ice cream at 10pm and other times,
bringing me, Agniv, and Benjamin to "What is?" every Tuesday / Thursday, then to dinner, and subsequently to Target (binge-buying :sunglasses::shopping_cart:),
teaching me interesting topics such as modal logic, Suslin trees, and back-and-forth arguments,
and also influencing my vernacular with questionable phrases in Chinese (together with Xinkai),
such as "哎呀我笨," "我真笨," and "一百五十AMC我操！" :rofl:
I know, for sure, that you'll breeze through all the graduate courses at UCSB --- you're just too good.
I hope to meet you in academia in the near future!

Although I wasn't sure at the beginning, now I get to say that Ross transformed me in the best possible way that I could imagine of:
I discovered tons of interesting mathematics, got to know lots of awesome people, and most importantly, had immense fun!
Really, I can't wait to come back next year :D
