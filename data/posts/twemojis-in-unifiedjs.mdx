Hi! In this article, I'll talk about how to add twemojis to [rehype.js](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype).

Since emojis had first got into the web, they always took people's attention, as they were a totally new language.
Everyone loves emojis, right? Me too. I personally consider myself an emoji enthusiast.
I use emojis all the time, and without doubt, [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.com) is my best friend.

However, since emojis are system-dependent, some emojis that look pretty in your environment might just show nothing at all for other environments.

How can we solve this problem? Well, we have custom emojis!

Custom emojis are emojis that are displayed as images instead of ordinary plain text.
By using custom emojis, we, as developers, can equally provide a consistent user experience for everyone. Hooray!

Nevertheless, there are plentiful number of custom emojis to choose from.

Microsoft's Segoe UI Emoji is also aesthetically pleasing, but it has a strict license, so it's actually not good, if you ever plan to use it commercially.

But hey, [twemoji](https://twemoji.twitter.com/)ðŸŽ‰ to the rescue! It's totally free, open sourced --- but more importantly, it's really pretty!
Even this website uses twemojis!

Okay, so all is good, but how do we actually apply twemojis to rehype.js?

### Installation

First, let's talk about how to convert ordinary emojis to twemojis.
Previously, there were no plugins to convert ordinary emojis to twemojis, but don't be sad, I made one!
You can install the [rehype-twemojify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rehype-twemojify) plugin with `yarn`, `npm`, `pnpm` or whatever package manager you prefer.
I'll do it with yarn, (not yarn v2, but yarn classic) since yarn is fast and lightweight.

```bash
yarn add --dev rehype-twemojify // For yarn
```

```bash
npm i --save-dev rehype-twemojify // For npm
```

Now that you've installed it, try adding it to your rehype plugin list.
If you don't have rehype yet, you can install it using this command:

```bash
yarn add --dev rehype // For yarn
```

```bash
npm i --save-dev rehype // For npm
```

### Configuration

Now, you can use `rehype-twemojify` as follows:

```ts
import rehype from 'rehype';
import rehypeTwemojify from 'rehype-twemojify';

rehype().use(rehypeTwemojify);
```

If you're using [contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/) (which is really awesome, check it out) just like me, you can do the following:

```ts:contentlayer.config.ts
import rehypeTwemojify from 'rehype-twemojify';

const contentlayerConfig = makeSource({
  mdx: {
    rehypePlugins: [[rehypeTwemojify]]
  }
});

export default contentlayerConfig;
```

For most people, this should be enough. But if you want to customize, the next section is for you.

### Next.js--Specific Options

If you're using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), here's a custom configuration, which supports using `/_next/image`, instead of the default one.

Just add `framework: 'next'`, and you're good to go.

If you want to use your own twemoji files, you can add your custom base, which can be configured using `twemoji: { baseUrl: '/YOUR/BASE' }`.
By default, if your files are located at `/public/static/images/twemoji`, you should write `/static/images/twemoji` (since everything that goes in `/public` is located at the root of your website, at least in Next.js).

Furthermore, you can set your images' width and quality via the `w` and `q` parameters in the `params` object.

`params.w` is the width, and you can read more information about it on [this page](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/18413).

`params.q` is the quality of the image, and usually for emojis that use small images, `40` to `70` is okay.
Images should be rendered even if you set `params.q` to `1`.

Actually, you can add more parameters if you want. Internally, it works by appending those parameters to the image query url.

You can also exclude some characters that you don't want to transform, such as the `Â©` character, by setting the `exclude` array.

Anyway, the following is a complete configuration for Next.js.

```ts:contentlayer.config.ts
import rehypeTwemojify from 'rehype-twemojify';

const contentlayerConfig = makeSource({
  mdx: {
    rehypePlugins: [
      [
        rehypeTwemojify,
        {
          params: { w: 32, q: 100 },
          twemoji: { size: 'svg', baseUrl: '/static/images/twemoji' },
          exclude: ['Â©', 'Â®', 'â„¢', 'â„—', 'â†©']
          framework: 'next',
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
});

export default contentlayerConfig;
```

### List of other configurations

If you're curious what other configurations you can do, here's the list.

- `framework`: `'next'`, optional. When used, the images are optimized via `/_next/image`.
- `params`: `{[key: string]: any}`, optional. You can add any parameters you want to append to the image url.
- `folder`: `string`, optional. You may specify the folder that has the emojis, e.g., `svg` or `72x72`.
- `twemoji.baseUrl`: `string`, optional. The base url; by default `https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/latest`.
- `twemoji.size`: `string`, optional. The size of the assets; by default `72x72`; can be set to `svg` (SVGs don't have a specific size).
- `exclude`: `string[]`, optional. Specify characters that you want to exclude from the conversion process.

Phew, that was really long. Thanks for reading! Goodbye :) ðŸ›¸
