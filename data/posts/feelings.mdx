summary: Some thoughts on how frequently feelings guide us.

Here's a question: Why can't people think of anarcho-capitalism in a logical manner?

Because they have strong *feelings* that we somehow need government, which is typically indoctrinated to children, teenagers, and young adults, through K-12 and college, other people, as well as ALL forms of media, so that they perceive such as something "normal", which incites a feeling of calmness (and perhaps satisfaction) which is exactly what the government wants them to feel and believe. Early forms of emotions towards certain objects are "educated" in the subtle form of "that's wrong", "don't do that", "how dare you question [insert authority here]", "you will know that [insert oxymoron behavior] has a reason when you grow up", etc without further explanation or only quasi-explanation that has been conjured up for the sake of explanation, instead of it being the most simple explanation out of all logical possibilities (Occam's razor).

Why can't we operate on the basis of natural rights and morality derived from such negative natural rights? Why *must* governments exist? Why *must* people give up their natural rights, when there is no such thing as a "social contract"? A typical answer is that "it just doesn't work that way" without further explanation. When an anarcho-capitalist replies to such with the logical mechanisms and coherent assumptions about individual actors, why it is the only *morally coherent* ideology, as well as the roadmap of practical implementations of it to existing society, to such, usually comes the reply "but then who will maintain the roads" and so on and so forth, which --- if it is that person's first encounter of anarcho-capitalism --- is reasonable given that they do not have much capabilities to perform coherent logical deductions from a few given principles (which they may or may not believe in), but otherwise such questions come typically NOT from not understanding the rationale behind the ideology but rather from it not coinciding with the person's internal value propositions (which are mostly guided by feelings).

Also, people feel horrible to openly state that it is their feelings that cloud their logical deductions of consequences, so they rather add extra layers of facade of asking the same (or quasi-isomorphic, whose answers can be deduced from the exact same principles with just some thought, such as asking "who will maintain the street lights" et cetera) questions again and again, not properly thinking about what may and may not be deduced from the given principles, and so on. This is typical behavior of politicians as well --- ironic because people blame such speak, yet the exact people who blame that kind of speak perform such rationalizations every day.

The words people use --- "bullshit", "horrible", etc --- to describe ideologies like anarcho-capitalism, typically have no substance but only emotion, unlike the actual contractual arguments / natural rights arguments anarcho-capitalist thinkers make (David Friedman, Murray Rothbard, etc). Yet the dominant ideology is NOT anarcho-capitalism, but statism. Why? Because feelings are more primitive, such that people use it as their primary guide. A significant number of people believe that feelings exist in silence, just coming up to the surface sometimes, and that they mostly 'think things through', but such "thinking" is rather to intuit things, instead of actually using System 2 --- feelings give us intuition, which is rather System 1 in operation. Logic only confirms intuition; if logic contradicts intuition, humans typically cannot comprehend such dissonance, so they typically resort to dissociation from fact (unless they are a bold one) and rather believe in their feelings. Also, it's typically the case when people say that something "doesn't make sense", it just means such thing contradicted their layers of belief, which have ultimately formed their feelings toward outward objects as well as inward ideas, instead of it being just a consequence of a pure logical contradiction (people don't really *think* about logic, since they confuse even basic propositional logic; no wonder most people can't discern different logical systems on which their brains operate). Even at the point of writing this, my writing is mostly done through intuition and feelings; it's just that my logic coincides with my feelings so I can trust my feelings of what is logically correct better, which means I have to go back and check if my statements actually logically make sense, in order for it to be 'truly logical'. But this leads to a deeper issue: is something logical only when it is perceived to be? Is there an absolute criterion that determines whether something is done logically or not? Does the method by which such "logic" is deduced matter --- if it's through actual 'if this then that'? Is the way we think 'if this then that' also guided by feelings? I think so.

Another phenomenon I noticed was that even the "smartest" people have problems in applying logically consistent ideas from one field to another (or subfields, even if they're both in, say, mathematics), such as thinking in terms of different logical axioms when logically deducing some fact. Just an example, but most mathematicians ignore subtle distinctions regarding provability versus truth value, the 'strength' of a direct proof versus proof by contradiction, and many other subtle issues, when they're working on "actual" problems. This is, for one, useful because it's essentially performing lots of abstraction to get rid of all unnecessary components for thought, but also, it's a sort of debunking of the (probably commonly held) belief that people that are perceived as 'logical' in some area are logical in other areas as well.

Even mathematicians, who are typically thought of very logical people, deeply believe in feelings, probably more than the ordinary person in some ways; they have problems that they feel is 'elegant', while some problems are 'disgusting', and mostly the sacred intuition that is so praised comes from the feeling that this should work --- people are often more afraid to say 'i think that this method works' (which implies the existence of a reasoning behind *why* that method should work) than 'i feel like this should work' (which is a fail-safe way of suggesting that method, since the latter is closer to the fact, where this method just 'feels' right). If we purged mathematicians of any capability to feel emotions, a lot of them would no longer pursue mathematics at all, because their most important faculty, intuition, is gone, but also because mathematicians do math not *because of* logic but because of something like its innate beauty (which is felt through emotions) or external recognition (which is felt as well, rather than reasoned).
