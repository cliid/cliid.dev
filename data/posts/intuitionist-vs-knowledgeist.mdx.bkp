This involves a personal introspection derived from my own experiences, transitioning from a period of entrenched knowledgeism to the ongoing process of dismantling that aspect of myself in favor of embracing intuitionism.

# Intuitionism versus Knowledgeism: A Philosophical Dichotomy

Before delving into the intricacies of this transformation, it's essential to establish the philosophical dichotomy between intuitionism and knowledgeism.

Intuitionists, emblematic of the "self" in this narrative, prioritize depth of understanding over the sheer accumulation of knowledge. Their focus lies on solving problems relevant to their domain, guided by a commitment to untainted, rational thinking. Intuitionists view the world as beautiful but distinguish it from people who are not, grounded in the recognition that the concept of "society" is a nonexistent entity. They reject societal expectations, considering them fundamentally purposeless to the individual, and avoid adhering to clichés and common adages.

Knowledgeists, on the other hand, represent the societal influence. They seek to accumulate and showcase knowledge, deriving pleasure from possessing exclusive information. The pursuit of formalities and the validation of societal norms are intrinsic to the knowledgeist mindset. Unlike intuitionists, knowledgeists often engage in the societal game of showcasing expertise and intellectual prowess.

# The Struggle of Self Against Social Constructs

The narrative centers around my personal struggle, embodying the transition from a knowledgeist mindset to embracing intuitionism.

I characterize the knowledgeist as a profound affliction spawned by what is commonly referred to as "society." This assertion is substantiated not only by mathematical considerations but extends beyond, drawing from Buddhist ideologies, particularly dialectical middle-ground thinking. This transformative journey involves discarding perpetual self-other comparisons, achievable only through distancing oneself from others and objectively scrutinizing the reasons behind collective suffering.

The remedy lies in shedding any inclination towards social validation, recognizing others as mere non-playable characters from an individual perspective. Any external projection of sentiments like "it would be disheartening to regard you as an NPC" fosters toxic intermediaries, inducing societal shame, guilt, and coerced desires to conform to an arbitrary definition of "goodness" to the detriment of the individual. Ayn Rand's "The Virtue of Selfishness" further informs this perspective.

# The Intuitionist Manifesto

Perspectives viewed through a "social" lens are inherently false and often toxic, contends the intuitionist. Pleasure for the intuitionist stems from untainted, rational thinking, driven by a quest for pure understanding, distinct from the knowledgeist's toxic trait of showcasing exclusive knowledge. The intuitionist dismisses societal expectations and the pursuit of being perceived as "good" by others as fundamentally purposeless to the individual. Adherence to clichés and common adages is considered foolish by the intuitionist. The intuitionist views others as non-playable characters in their life, minimizing their impact and significance.

Timing is crucial for the intuitionist, recognizing that the profound "click" moment cannot be forced but can be gently guided. Preservation of mental faculties, especially the gut-brain connection, is of utmost importance to the intuitionist. Understanding the external structure is a prerequisite for the intuitionist, with a commitment to build upon it only if it holds personal meaning. The intuitionist upholds the significance of preserving individual values and philosophies, never compromising on deeply understood principles. Social humility is rejected by the intuitionist, who engages in limited social interactions to prevent dilution of clear-cut thinking and unwanted moral compromises.

Conforming to random adages is considered the epitome of foolishness by the intuitionist. Other people are perceived as NPCs in the intuitionist's life, both in the literal Non-Playable sense and in the higher "they don't matter" sense. The *click* moment comes when it comes, and the intuitionist does not force it, allowing some guidance towards higher intuition to occur naturally. The utmost importance lies in the preservation of the intuitionist's own brain and its intuition, emphasizing the crucial gut-brain connection. The intuitionist strives to rationally understand the preexisting "external" structure, internalizing the why rather than the what, and never compromising on deeply understood principles. Mingling with people is avoided by the intuitionist, as it triggers a primal desire for social acceptance, leading to unintended moral compromises that compromise sharp intuition.

# Knowledgeist Profile with Additional Insights

The knowledgeist seeks to accumulate and display knowledge, often showcasing expertise in various fields. Deriving pleasure from possessing exclusive knowledge is a defining trait of the knowledgeist. The knowledgeist often indulges in formalities that could be avoided with greater mindfulness, including the unnecessary consumption of knowledge and the intellectual display thereof.

Realizing the dichotomy between intuitionism and knowledgeism is crucial, yet it's worth acknowledging that some knowledgeists may harbor intuitionist ideas, although rarely exercised due to the toxic tendencies accentuated by knowledgeism. This recognition adds nuance to the narrative, emphasizing the complexity of navigating these philosophical realms.
