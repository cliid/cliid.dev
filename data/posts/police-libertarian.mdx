summary: Why the heck does police brutality even happen?
---

Indeed, there are some factors concerning white supremacy that do contribute to police brutality, however, it is considerably less than authority conferred upon the police by the state. Shall I make a bold claim, that the state is the problem for all this matter. Police brutality is not solely a matter of the United States. No. It is everywhere, but just more dramatized in the U.S., because of the acclaimed gunshots and “accidents” due to the predominant existence of guns. But then we ask, should we ban guns? Maybe yes. But as we see, police brutality does exist and even thrive in other seemingly more “peaceful” countries that prohibit the possession or purchase of guns, such as Italy, France, the United Kingdom, and Philippines.

Then, what constitutes the core problem that causes police brutality? It can be summed up into one word: “power.” Authoritarian dictatorship, no matter in what form, either the so-called “democracy” where people basically give their powers to the police, or “real” dictatorship like Tito or Mussolini, causes police brutality. For it is obvious to the layperson that such “real” authoritarian dictatorships cause police brutality, I shall further illuminate the cause for the tyranny of the majority case. Many simply believe that the police with such powers will not turn against the people themselves; however, would they be so nice that they will not use them to fulfill their own needs but work for the common good, ignoring the fact that the state is made up of humans who possess and regularly exercise selfishness. If you are one of them, I suggest going to ant-land. There, you will fulfill that utopian belief, I ensure you. Just reincarnate as an ant.
 
Further facts, state power causes much more consequences than the narrow sense of police brutality. Look at all the tragedies caused solely by state power. Giving someone full power to control oneself whilst thinking he shall treat you well, without his any further knowledge about the future benefits of keeping you intact, is lunacy. Look, you are enslaving yourself, merely for the sweet notion of safety. Oh, well, if he’s so kind, he could indeed keep you safe, but does he really? Never have you heard of the September attacks, where “U.S. intelligence agencies knew the identity of the hijacker in question, Saudi national Khalid al Mihdhar, long before 9/11 and had the ability to find him, but they failed to do so?” Or the strongest government in the world that cannot even get rid of drugs or pedophiles? How can you ensure you are really safe? Besides, even if you’re safe, so what. You’re now treated as a serf for the rest of your life, due to the “social contract” that neither benefits us nor has existence whatsoever, whereas the abstract concepts of math and physics at least enhance our lives.
 
“But, doesn’t police brutality have some causal relationships with white supremacy? What about George Floyd?” says the Democrat layperson. As I said, I am not refuting the existence of the notion and act of white supremacy nor its causal relationship with police brutality. Instead, I am arguing that there is a significantly greater cause for it: state power. Let’s say you had a headache, and when you just lie down with some posture, you feel a bit better. Then why bother going to the hospital? Just stay in your bed and lie down, ignoring a possible tumor. You don’t. Because you know that actually curing your tumor or cause of migraines rather than just thinking it will be okay is a better solution. The same goes for police brutality as well.
