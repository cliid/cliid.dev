# Choosing Distros

There are an infinite number of distros that you can choose from, but you don't need to try all of 'em.

A couple of famous distros are: Arch, Debian, Ubuntu, and RHEL.
There are also Arch-like, Debian-like, Ubuntu-like distros as well, and I'll firmly introduce them as well.

## For Tinkerers

If you want to try tinkering with your own system, I suggest EndeavourOS.

Why EndeavourOS?

- Arch-like distro. Highly customizable.
- It directly uses Arch's main repo, which means you get the latest fixes and features.
- You can install it via a graphical interface, which is quite cool.
- The community is very helpful, and has lots of advanced users.
- Free to choose between Xfce, Budgie, Cinnamon, Deepin, i3, KDE Plasma 5, LXQt, Mate, or GNOME.

There are other Arch-like distros as well.
Artix, Arco, Manjaro, Garuda, and much more.
Try them if you want to, but sticking with Endeavour won't be a bad experience.

# Choosing a DE

I personally don't use a DE. It's bloated. I rather use the i3 window manager, since it's fast and simple.

# Choosing a WM
