# Introduction

Howdy! In this article, I will talk about how to add twemojis to [rehype.js](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype).

Since emojis had first got into the web, they always took people's attention, as they were a totally new language.
Everyone loves emojis, right? Me too. I personally consider myself an emoji enthusiast.
I use emojis all the time, and undoubtfully, [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.com) is my best friend.

However, since emojis are system-dependent, some emojis that look pretty in your environment might just show nothing at all for others.
How to solve this problem? Well, we have custom emojis! Custom emojis are emojis that are displayed as images instead of ordinary plain text.
By using custom emojis, we, developers can equally provide a consistent user experience for everyone. Hooray!
Nevertheless, there are plentiful number of custom emojis to choose from.
Microsoft's Segoe UI Emoji is also good, but since it has a strict license, it's actually quite not... good.
But hey, [twemoji](https://twemoji.twitter.com/) to the rescue! It's totally free, open sourced, and more importantly, pretty!
I'm using it on my website, too! âš¡âš¡

...

Okay, so we will use twemojis, but how can we apply them to rehype?

# Installation

Yeah, let's talk about how to convert ordinary emojis to twemojis.
Previously, there were no plugins to convert ordinary emojis to twemojis, but don't be sad, I made one!
You can install the [rehype-twemojify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rehype-twemojify) plugin with `yarn`, `npm`, `pnpm` or whatever package manager you prefer.
I'll do it with yarn, (not yarn v2, but yarn classic) since yarn is fast and lightweight.

```
yarn add --dev rehype-twemojify // For yarn
```

```
npm i --save-dev rehype-twemojify // For NPM
```

Now that you've installed it, try adding it to your rehype plugin list.
If you don't have rehype yet, install it using this command:

```
yarn add --dev rehype // For Yarn
```

```
npm i --save-dev rehype // For NPM
```

And simply run this plugin as follows.

# Configurations

```ts
import rehype from 'rehype';
import rehypeTwemojify from 'rehype-twemojify';

rehype().use(rehypeTwemojify);
```

Or, for [contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/), you could do this:

```ts:contentlayer.config.ts
import rehypeTwemojify from 'rehype-twemojify';

const contentLayerConfig = makeSource({
  mdx: {
    rehypePlugins: [[rehypeTwemojify]]
  }
});

export default contentLayerConfig;
```

# Next.js Specific Config

And if you're using Next.js, here's a custom configuration, which supports using `/_next/image`, instead of the default one.

Just add `isNext: true` and your custom base, which can be configured using `base: '/YOUR/BASE'`.<br />
Custom base is required because Next.js does not support external links using `/_next/image`.

By the way, if you're doing this way, you should download all twemoji images and put them in your `/public/twemoji` folder.<br />
The `/public/twemoji` folder should have two subfolders: `72x72` and `svg`. If it has those two folders, you're okay.<br />
Then, give the base like such: `/twemoji`.<br />
Furthermore, `params.w` and `params.q` are also required, because that's what Next.js requires.<br />
`params.w` is the width, and you can read more about it [here](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/18413).<br />
`params.q` is the quality of the image, and usually for emojis that use small images, `5` to `40` is okay.<br />
It should be fine even if you set it to `1`. Anyway, this is the config for Next.js.

```ts:contentlayer.config.ts
import rehypeTwemojify from 'rehype-twemojify';

const contentLayerConfig = makeSource({
  mdx: {
    rehypePlugins: [
      [
        rehypeTwemojify,
        {
          isNext: true,
          base: '/twemoji',
          params: {
            w: 3840,
            q: 40
          }
        }
      ]
    ]
  }
});

export default contentLayerConfig;
```

# Configurations

If you're curious what configurations you can do, here's the list.

- `params`: `{[key: string]: any}`, optional. Any params you want to put for the image URI.
- `folder`: `string`, optional. The folder that has emojis, e.g., `svg`, `72x72`.
- `base`: `string`, optional. The base url, by default `https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/latest`
- `ext`: `string`, optional. The image extension, by default `.png`
- `size`: `string`, optional. The assets size, by default `72x72`

Thanks for reading, as always! Goodbye. ðŸ›¸
