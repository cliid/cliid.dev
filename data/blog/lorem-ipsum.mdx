A true legend. The mother of all placeholders. Almost every web developer and designer knows it. Used for centuries.
Very text-ish and elegant. However, what does it mean? Why do we use especially that text?

# Introduction

Lorem Ipsum is a piece of text, used by designers to fill a space where the content will eventually sit.
It helps show how text will look once a piece of content is finished, during the planning phase.

Filler text has been widely used for centuries, so most people are familiar with seeing Lorem Ipsum on a mock design.
This means, when a designer sends their template to a client, they won’t get distracted by the copy on-page.

The word Lorem Ipsum comes from a Latin text by the Roman philosopher Cicero.
But it has gone through significant changes over the centuries, with words being taken out, shortened, and added in.
The word 'lorem,' for example, isn’t a real Latin word, it’s a shortened version of the word 'dolorem,' meaning pain.

This makes the current dummy text impossible to translate into English. However, the original source was translated in 1914 to mean:

> Nor is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself,
> because it is pain, but occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure.

# Why do we use Lorem Ipsum?

In short, we use Lorem Ipsum because it doesn’t make sense.
It’s simply a placeholder, so doesn’t need to hold any meaningful messaging.

Content is intended to stand out on a page.
So, if a designer or client is reviewing a template and its layout,
they can easily become distracted by the writing and lose focus of the design itself.

It also looks and reads more natural than just repeating a phrase like ‘content here’ or ‘example content’.
Adding Lorem Ipsum text simply gives a flavour of what the final page may look like.

# Where does Lorem Ipsum originally come from?

The text can be sourced all the way back to ancient Rome.
Many of the words and phrases in today’s Lorem Ipsum copy can be found in a book on ethics from 45 BC,
written by the Roman philosopher, Cicero.

However, researchers believe the text wasn’t actually used as a placeholder in its current form until the 1500s.
This is when a printer took the original text and scrambled its order, to make a specimen book.

Even as we developed new technologies in the 20th and 21st centuries,
Lorem Ipsum endured as our preferred filler text.
In the 1960s, the text was printed on dry-transfer sheets and used by architects and advertisers alike.
Then, in the 1980s, it was adopted into word-processing templates on desktop computers.

Nowadays, you can find it on almost any piece of software designed for writers or designers,
from Microsoft Word templates to WordPress web designs and Google Docs. Quite a journey through time from its humble beginnings!

# How to create Lorem Ipsum copy

There are software tools out there that can generate different versions of the traditional Lorem Ipsum to change up your mock content.
They can simply mix up the orders or even add humorous sections of text in Latin too.

If you’ve only got a short gap to fill in your design, you can simply copy the Lorem Ipsum text above and paste it into your template.

For longer pieces of content, you can create additional nonsensical text on a variety of external websites,
using a [Lorem Ipsum generator](https://www.lipsum.com/).
Just select your paragraphs and word lengths, whether you need it in HTML or text form, and create your own Lorem Ipsum copy.
